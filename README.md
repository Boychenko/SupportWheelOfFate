# Description
I made some simplification because this is just a test project. Some of them I'll probably fix later as exercise
## 1. Database structure
I made it quite simple. In real project I'd add Shifts table with start/end properties
## 2. API
I'd add CRUD endpoints for Engineers and Shifts in normal project.
## 3 Hangfire
Just took it to try. For Azure I consider web jobs
## 4 Integration tests
Removed from scope for now.
